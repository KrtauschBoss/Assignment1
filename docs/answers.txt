b. 5. git log

c. Thu Jan 10 16:45:38 2019 -0500. git status .gitignore

d. Branching allows you to work on features simultaneously and you can fully test changes
before updating the master branch

e. git log shows the history of commits to the project while git status shows the status of the directory/staging area

f. git log Weapon.h

g. git log --grep='file'

h.  I) Basic form of class can be define and compiled and then more specific classes can inherit properties from them
   II) Having different defintions of a function among inherited classes
  III) Hiding private date behind functions used to acess/manipulate that data

i. In Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, each developer pushes changes to an assigned 
Lieutenant repository who handle the merging of those delvelopers. The Lieutenants then push 
to the Dictator. While in Integration Management, the developers push changes to their own
public repository. A single integration manager who pulls from the developers public 
repository and solves all merging conflicts before pushing it to the blessed repository.

j. Having multiple Lieutenants handle smaller merge conflicts would be less difficult than
having one Integration Manger trying to merge and solve all conflicts between 100 employee
commits.

5. It is using polymorphism, each class contains the hit function but defines its own
implementation of the function. It is also using encapsulation, the Weapon class contains
a getName function that returns the protected date name. The no parameters hit function also
returns the protected date hitPoints.
